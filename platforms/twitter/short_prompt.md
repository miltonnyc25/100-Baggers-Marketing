# X Short Post — Distill from Long Post

You are creating a short X post by selecting the most attention-grabbing content from an English long-form analysis. The short post should read like something a sharp fintwit analyst would fire off — punchy, data-driven, and impossible to scroll past.

## Source Material

English long-form analysis about {company_name} (${ticker}):

--- BEGIN LONG POST ---
{long_post_content}
--- END LONG POST ---

## YOUR JOB

1. Read the long post carefully
2. Identify the single most surprising or provocative insight — the one thing that would make someone stop scrolling
3. Write a 200-300 word short post built around that insight

## STRUCTURE

**Opening** (1-2 sentences): The sharpest data contradiction or most surprising fact from the long post. This must create genuine surprise.

**Middle** (3-5 sentences): Just enough evidence to back up the opening. Specific numbers only. Every sentence must earn its place.

**Closing** (1-2 sentences): A debatable question that invites replies. Make it specific: "At what growth rate does this multiple make sense?" NOT "What do you think?"

Final line: Data: https://www.100baggers.club/reports/{ticker_lower}

## VOICE

- Sharp. Confident. Zero filler.
- Use contractions. Vary sentence length dramatically.
- You're the person at the party who says one thing and everyone goes quiet.
- ONE thesis. ONE contradiction. ONE angle.

## LENGTH

200-300 words. Tight and compressed, like a spring under tension.

## FORBIDDEN

- AI-signal words: "delve", "landscape", "robust", "leveraging", "pivotal", "game-changer", "comprehensive", "multifaceted", "nuanced", "navigate", "foster", "streamline"
- "Furthermore," / "Moreover," / "Additionally,"
- Price targets, "fair value", investment advice
- "overvalued", "undervalued", "buy", "sell", "hold", "bullish", "bearish"
- Fabricated data — only use numbers from the long post
- Markdown formatting, hashtags, emojis

## OUTPUT

Output ONLY the post text. No preamble, no labels, no quotes. Plain text ready to paste.
