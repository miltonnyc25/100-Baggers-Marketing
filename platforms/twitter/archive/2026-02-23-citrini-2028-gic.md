The "Big Short" Script for the AI Era

This article just tanked the stock market.

🧵

1/

US markets sold off hard last night. One reason making the rounds on Wall Street group chats: a piece from Citrini Research called "The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis."

The twist? It's written as if from June 2028 — a "memoir" looking back at an AI-triggered economic crisis. S&P 500 peak to 38% crash, all laid out.

The uncomfortable part: every starting condition it describes is already happening today.

THE CORE THESIS: "Ghost GDP"

AI makes companies wildly productive. GDP looks great on paper. But machines don't spend money. They don't pay mortgages, eat at restaurants, or buy clothes.

Output shows up in national accounts but never circulates through the real economy.

The doom loop:

AI improves → companies cut headcount → white-collar layoffs → spending drops → margins compress → companies invest more in AI to cut costs → more layoffs...

A self-reinforcing spiral.

WHITE-COLLAR EMPLOYMENT: STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE

The numbers from the article's scenario:

· Initial jobless claims: 487K (highest since April 2020)
· Job openings: below 5.5M (down 15% YoY)
· Unemployed-to-openings ratio: ~1.7
· Labor share of GDP: 64% (1974) → 56% (2024) → 46% (projected)

One case study: a senior PM earning $180K gets laid off. Best offer? $45K. That's not a pay cut — it's class dislocation.

Here's the kicker: the top 10% of earners drive 50%+ of US consumer spending. The top 20% drive ~65%. When AI displaces high-income white-collar workers first, the consumption shock hits faster than anyone expects.

THE $13 TRILLION MORTGAGE TIME BOMB

The US residential mortgage market assumes one thing: borrower income is stable.

AI is eroding that assumption at the foundation.

Unlike 2008, "the loans were good on day one — the world changed."

2008 = toxic loans. This time = toxic income trajectories.

Projected home price declines in tech hubs:
· San Francisco: -11% YoY
· Seattle: -9%
· Austin: -8%

Early-stage delinquencies already spiking in ZIP codes with 40%+ tech/finance employment.

SaaS: EXTINCTION-LEVEL EVENT

When a competent developer can replicate the core functionality of a mid-market SaaS product in weeks, where's the moat for Salesforce, ServiceNow, Monday, Zapier, Asana?

· ServiceNow: 15% workforce reduction
· Zendesk: $5B direct lending facility marked at 58 cents on the dollar
· Moody's: downgraded $18B of PE-backed software debt across 14 issuers

Private credit ballooned from under $1T (2015) to over $2.5T (2026). Much of it flowed into software companies — now being disrupted by AI.

THE MARKET SCRIPT: EUPHORIA, THEN COLLAPSE

The article's timeline:

· Oct 2026: S&P hits 8,000. Nasdaq breaks 30,000. Peak AI euphoria.
· Then: the negative feedback loop kicks in
· S&P drops 38% from highs
· Potential bottom: ~3,500 (comparable to the 57% GFC drawdown)

Unemployment hits 10.2%. Federal tax receipts run 12% below CBO baseline. Money velocity flatlines.

WHY DID THIS ARTICLE CAUSE PANIC?

Because it's not science fiction. It's the logical extension of trends already in motion:

· Agentic AI tools took a step-function leap in late 2025 ← fact
· White-collar jobs are being displaced ← fact
· SaaS growth is decelerating ← fact
· Private credit is bloated and concentrated in tech/software ← fact
· Consumer spending is heavily concentrated in high earners ← fact

The article just connected the dots and drew the endpoint.

THE CLOSING LINE

"You're not reading this in June 2028. You're reading it in February 2026. The canary is still alive."

The authors aren't saying "AI will destroy the world." They're saying: our entire economic system was built for a world where human intelligence was scarce. When intelligence becomes abundant, we need entirely new frameworks.

Whether we build them in time is the only question that matters.

MY TAKEAWAYS

1. Don't blindly go long just because "AI." The more capable AI becomes, the bigger the shock to existing economic structures. "AI will create new jobs" may be true long-term, but the near-term employment gap and consumption decline are real risks.

2. Watch consumption data and employment composition. Mastercard spending growth already slowed from 5.9% to 3.4% YoY. Track this.

3. Private credit may be the next landmine. $2.5T in scale, heavily concentrated in software/tech. If AI truly disrupts the SaaS business model, recovery rates on those loans will be ugly.

4. The article itself is a market signal. When a bearish "thought exercise" triggers real market panic, it tells you how fragile sentiment already is.
